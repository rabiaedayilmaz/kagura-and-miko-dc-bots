# kagura-and-miko-dc-bots
Kagura and Miko sisters are my original characters and the purpose of these sisters is to help and motivate with your studies.
Currently, two-user-mode is supported.
I own these characters and the art.
Who would you pick among these sisters and why? (I think Kagura is prettier :3)
************************************************************************
## Kagura
Say *Hello* to Kagura and she will respond you. :wave:  

By writing "-whoami" and "-whoareyou", she can surprise you. :thinking:	 
Also, whenever you write your to-do-list for tomorrow, she will encourage you with emojis. :hugs:

Kagura starts to track your sessions with `.study` command.
Each session is 25 minutes, so you'd better study in that time!
For each completed session, she will count and keep logs.
To learn your counted sessions, command her `.count` and see your progress.

## Miko-chan
Here is the hard-working Miko-chan!

By commanding `.help`, you can access more info.
Before the midnight, if you write your to-do-list for tomorrow, she will send you a midnight DM! :love_letter:
Like her sister, she will encourage you with emojis. :hugs:

She likes to be organized and for each user:
* Task List: Keeps task list for you, just use `<task message>++`
* Reminder List: Keeps reminder list by using `<reminder message> + <reminder time span>` and pokes you :eyes:

To clear list:
* Just clear reminder list by `.clear r`
* Just clear task list by `.clear t`
* Or all of them :broom: by `.clear all`

She tracks your activities on to-do-list channel and for every entry, you will gain 5 pomi-points!
To see your pomi-points, use `.pomi`

Last but not least, you can set a timer (sounds like a little wannabe) by using like `.time 30m`
But she can reverse count from 1800, that's why max. time is 30 minutes.  

Do not forget to say "good girl" her! :hand_over_mouth:
